## ⚙️ Major Technical Contributions  

### 1. Leanrned Test Infrastructure for .NET MAUI    
- Learned **infrastructure utilities** for device setup, Appium driver configuration, and CI environment synchronization. And passed the knowledge with entire open source contribution team in syncfusion.  
- Worked on improving test pipeline stability in **Azure DevOps** and **GitHub Actions**, ensuring reliable parallel runs.  

### 2. Migration from Xamarin.UITest → Appium  
- Led the migration from **Xamarin.UITest** to **Appium**, modernizing the testing framework for .NET MAUI.  
- Enhanced cross-platform capability with modular test base classes and reusable page objects.  
- Contributed to MAUI-specific Appium utilities that simplified setup and improved debugging during failures.  

### 3. Test Stabilization & Infrastructure Diagnostics  
- Diagnosed **intermittent infrastructure-level failures**, such as CI timeouts, emulator instability, and device sync issues.  
- Developed helper libraries for better logging, element tracing, and recovery from test interruptions.  
- Reduced **flaky test failure rate**, improving overall CI throughput and confidence in PR validation.  

### 🧪 4. Feature Matrix test cases for all MAUI Controls, Layouts. 
- Pepared a testbed sample to integrate all the APIs and wrote UI test cases with all possible APIs combinations.
