## ⚙️ Major Technical Contributions  

### 🧩 1. Unified Test Infrastructure for .NET MAUI  
- Contributed to the **test harness architecture**, enabling consistent execution of unit, device, and UI tests across different environments.  
- Implemented **infrastructure utilities** for device setup, Appium driver configuration, and CI environment synchronization.  
- Worked on improving test pipeline stability in **Azure DevOps** and **GitHub Actions**, ensuring reliable parallel runs.  

### 🚀 2. Migration from Xamarin.UITest → Appium  
- Led the migration from **Xamarin.UITest** to **Appium**, modernizing the testing framework for .NET MAUI.  
- Enhanced cross-platform capability with modular test base classes and reusable page objects.  
- Contributed to MAUI-specific Appium utilities that simplified setup and improved debugging during failures.  

### 🧠 3. Test Stabilization & Infrastructure Diagnostics  
- Diagnosed **intermittent infrastructure-level failures**, such as CI timeouts, emulator instability, and device sync issues.  
- Developed helper libraries for better logging, element tracing, and recovery from test interruptions.  
- Reduced **flaky test failure rate by over 60%**, improving overall CI throughput and confidence in PR validation.  

### 🧪 4. Multi-Layered Testing (UI, Device, and Unit Tests)  
- Designed and executed comprehensive **unit, device, and UI test suites** covering MAUI controls, layouts, pages, and platform APIs.  
- Integrated Appium-based device tests with MAUI’s unit test framework for **end-to-end validation**.  
- Contributed test improvements that supported future extensibility for partners and community maintainers.  

### 🧰 5. Compatibility → Platform-Specific Migration  
- Migrated **legacy compatibility test cases** to MAUI-native implementations.  
- Validated rendering accuracy, accessibility, and platform-specific behaviors using Appium and NUnit frameworks.
